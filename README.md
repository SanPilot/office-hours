# Motivation

Many of us are familiar with that sense of dread walking into office hours the day the homework is due to see the board is filled with about a million names for people queued up to get help. We all love office hours but there are some things we’ve noticed could be improved. That’s why we set out to build this app. 

# Goals / Benefits

Students
* Improve UI and UX for viewing the office hours schedule 
* Estimate wait times for students waiting to get help

TAs
* Create easy interface for a TA to see their own schedule  
* Improve efficiency by allowing TAs to group students who have similar questions 

Professors
* Generate insights by displaying most frequently asked questions for a given assignment 
* Provide dashboard to view total office hours load to allow for more efficient use of TA resources
