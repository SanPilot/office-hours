# Motivation

Many of us are familiar with that sense of dread walking into office hours the day the homework is due to see the board is filled with about a million names for people queued up to get help. We all love office hours but there are some things weâ€™ve noticed could be improved. Thatâ€™s why we set out to build this app.

# Goals / Benefits

Students

- Improve UI and UX for viewing the office hours schedule
- Estimate wait times for students waiting to get help

TAs

- Create easy interface for a TA to see their own schedule
- Improve efficiency by allowing TAs to group students who have similar questions

Professors

- Generate insights by displaying most frequently asked questions for a given assignment
- Provide dashboard to view total office hours load to allow for more efficient use of TA resources
